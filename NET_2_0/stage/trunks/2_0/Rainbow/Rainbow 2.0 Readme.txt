
Rainbow 2.0 Production
by Eric Ramseur | Rahul Singh

Install : 

New Setup:
- Create an empty database called Rainbow (or whatever you wish).
- Give a user dbo access to that database
- Change the connection string in web.config with your user and db
- Control - F5 in VS 2005 OR browse to the directory configured in IIS

Updating database:
1. Backup your database and files
2. Update your files overwriting old ones
3. Browse to your web site, a page will prompt you for update
4. Follow carefully instructions (click on the button, duh)
5. Sit back and watch it work (or not) and click finish button when done.

This version includes most to all of the features
listed below as it is a straight port of Rainbow 
2006 on the 2.0 framework.  Some features may not
work ( mostly in modules and will be minor) but can 
easily be modifiedor fixed by the community.  We will post information
on branching ( svn : code.google.com/p/rainbow ) via
the community.rainbowportal.net.  

Known Bugs :

  Must click on the home page to edit the home page
  as there is a bug in redirect.  This bug has been 
  fixed in the new Beta ( 2.1.0.1882f) but is very
  minor.
  
  XML/XSL
  
  There is a bug in the selecting of the style sheet
  which prevents this module from working.  I fixed it
  with a hack but I prefer a better fix.  You can just 
  set it to a temporary style sheet to mod your XML and 
  change that file as needed.
  
  FreeTextBox sometimes causes issues but can be swapped out
  for FCK V2 if needed.  The dlls can also be updated if needed.

Look and feel
Improved Zen theme engine by Jeremy Esland
Added new demo themes (screenshot)
Better Caching handling (no need of Cache Manager anymore)
Now each module may have its own css and current theme may override it

ZEN laytous options:
There are two properties on the ZenNavigation control 
"UsePathTraceInUrl" - true by default
"UsePageNameInUrl" - also true by default
set both to false to use standard friendly pagename instead

ZEN known issue:
Using ZEN menu as in the default skin zenexample on a very large site (more than 1000 pages)
in IE can have a big load on CPU.
It is not recommended to use ZEN menu on large sites.
It is an IE issue, Firefox works correctly.

Security
by Danijel Kecman
Hash+Salt for password. 
Password not plaint text in db anymore.

Bug Fixes
A lot of old and new bug fixed

Breaking changes!

Big rename from Tab to Page in code.
Old Tab methods still availabe for backward compatibility.
However:

Change in allDesktopLayouts that refers to TabStripDetails class to PageStripDetails

example:
search for (usually used on DesktopPortalBanner.aspx)
<a href="<%#Rainbow.HttpUrlBuilder.BuildUrl(((Rainbow.Configuration.TabStripDetails) Container.DataItem).TabID)%>"><%# ((Rainbow.Configuration.TabStripDetails) Container.DataItem).TabName %></a>
and replace with:
<a href="<%#Rainbow.HttpUrlBuilder.BuildUrl(((Rainbow.Configuration.PageStripDetails) Container.DataItem).PageID)%>"><%# ((Rainbow.Configuration.PageStripDetails) Container.DataItem).PageName %></a>

or you get an error like this:
System.Web.HttpUnhandledException: Generata eccezione di tipo System.Web.HttpUnhandledException. ---> System.InvalidCastException: Cast specificato non valido.
   at ASP.DesktopPortalBanner_ascx.__DataBind__control10(Object sender, EventArgs e) in C:\Dev\Rainbow\SVN\DEV\Design\DesktopLayouts\OldTabsMenuHWLeft\DesktopPortalBanner.ascx:line 79
