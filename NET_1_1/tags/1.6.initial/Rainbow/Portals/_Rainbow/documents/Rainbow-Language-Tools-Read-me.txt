Rainbow Languages Tools
-----------------------

Based on version 1.6.0.1880c

Rainbow-Languages.XLS is a collection of all languages
in the Rainbow Project.
Working in Excel is much more easier then do the same in Access.

Usage:
Translate your language. If you don't know how to translate, leave the file blank.
The invariant settings will be used by Rainbow.
Replace the following character in your translation:

"<" replace with "&lt;"
">" replace with "&gt;"
"&" replace with "&amp;"

This is needed for the later transformation into the resource file.
When you are finish you can import the excel file into the Access DB.
Delete the content of the table "Esperantus_Language" before. Then import.

Adding a new language:
Excel-File:
Add a column with the Header name of the new language
(e.g. "en-US" for English United States). Translate your new language.
Access:
Check "Active" the entry of the new language in the Access table "Esperantus_CulturesList".
Add a row in Design Mode in the table "Esperantus_Language" within your new languages.

Import the excel file. After restarting the Access DB, you can buildup the RESx-Files.
Place that files in the /Resource/ Dir of your Rainbow Project and compile the solution.
Your translation is then in place.
