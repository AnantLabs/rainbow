#summary How to locally svn:ignore frequently ignored stuff without changing any property in the repository

No need to explicitely ignore frequently ignored stuff stuff. 

You can use global config.
You can find it in *%USERPROFULE%\Application Data\Subversion\config* file  on Windows 
systems.

You have to find the section *{{{[miscellany]}}}* and uncomment the *{{{global-ignores}}}* key

For *ASP.Net* and other *.Net* development it is recommended to ignore the following list of signatures:

{{{
global-ignores = bin obj _old Bin *.suo *.user *.db Thumbs.db *.pdb *.csproj.user
}}}
