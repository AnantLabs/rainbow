Rainbow Portal is a .Net 2.0 Open Source Content Management System based on ASP.NET, C# and SQL Server. It has the following minimum software requirements to be run as a web application:

  * Microsoft IIS (Internet Management Server) 5.0 or later*:
  _(Rainbow can also be run using Cassini Personal Web Server. This method is not discussed in this document)_

  * Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0*

  * A minimum of SQL Server Express 2005 installed on the application server*

  OR

  * Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or greater*

Rainbow Portal is not designed to function with a Microsoft Access Database (97/XP/2003/2007) and is not supported.

= Installation =

==New Setup==
* Create an empty database called Rainbow (or whatever you wish) in

* Give a user dbo access to that database ( this will change to lower access)

* Change the connection string in web.config with your user and db
  Please note that if you are using the 2.0 version ( not 2.1 or beta 2.1 ),
  the connection string is in <appsettings> and not the new
  Connection Strings methodology.  This feature was added in the 2.1 version.

* Control - F5 in VS 2005 OR browse to the directory configured in IIS

==Updating database==
* Backup your database and files

* Update your files overwriting old ones

* Browse to your web site, a page will prompt you for update

* Follow carefully instructions (click on the button, duh)

* Sit back and watch it work (or not) and click finish button when done.
