#summary Repository structure
#labels Featured
Structure is set in accordance to the following recommendations [http://community.rainbowportal.net/blogs/rahul_notes/archive/2006/02/10/338.aspx here in Rahul's blog]

  IMPORTANT! To *anonymously* _checkout_ or _export_ use *http* protocol.
  Otherwise if you have been granted with commit rights use *https* protocol to *authorized* _export_, _checkout_, _switch_, _commit_, other repository operations.

The root of the repository is *http://rainbow.googlecode.com/svn/* (*https://rainbow.googlecode.com/svn/*)
Do not checkout or export this url directly, you have to add a *relative path* to a structure unit for best result. Please remember that the relative paths are case sensitive.  

  WARNING! There is no ~~http://rainbow.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/~~  as it shown at [http://code.google.com/p/rainbow/source standard Google Code page of the Rainbow project]
 




We use our own structure instead of initially precreated structure. It is described below more detailed. You who has rights to commit please follow this structure and never make commits outside your sandbox.
